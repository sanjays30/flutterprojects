//Your Dart code can throw and catch exceptions. Exceptions are errors indicating
//that something unexpected happened
//In contrast to Java, all of Dartâ€™s exceptions are unchecked exceptions.
//Methods do not declare which exceptions they might throw, and you are not required to catch any exceptions.
