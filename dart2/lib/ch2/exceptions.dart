//Your Dart code can throw and catch exceptions. Exceptions are errors indicating
//that something unexpected happened
//In contrast to Java, all of Dartâ€™s exceptions are unchecked exceptions.
//Methods do not declare which exceptions they might throw, and you are not required to catch any exceptions.
main(List<String> args) {
  //Exception
  try {
    int.parse('dsdd');
  } catch (exception) {
    print(exception);
  }
  //Error objects thrown in the case of a program failure.
  //An Error object represents a program failure that the programmer should have avoided.
  try {
    var items = [];
    items.elementAt(1);
  } catch (exception) {
    print(exception);
  }

  // exception can be thrown
  try {
    throw Exception("some random error");
  } catch (exception) {
    print(exception);
  }
  //fun fact: even arbitrary objects can be thrown
  try {
    throw ["some random error", "do something"];
  } catch (exception) {
    print(exception);
